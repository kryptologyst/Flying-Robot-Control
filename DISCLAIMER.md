# SAFETY DISCLAIMER

## WARNING: DO NOT USE ON REAL HARDWARE WITHOUT EXPERT REVIEW

This project is designed for **RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PURPOSES ONLY**. 

### Critical Safety Information:

1. **NO REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENT**: This code has NOT been tested on actual flying robots and may cause:
   - Uncontrolled flight
   - Property damage
   - Personal injury or death
   - Violation of aviation regulations

2. **SIMULATION ONLY**: All controllers, dynamics models, and control algorithms are implemented for simulation environments only.

3. **EXPERT REVIEW REQUIRED**: Before any real-world application, this code must be:
   - Reviewed by qualified robotics engineers
   - Tested in controlled environments
   - Validated with proper safety systems
   - Compliant with local aviation regulations

4. **LIMITATIONS**: This implementation lacks:
   - Hardware-specific safety systems
   - Emergency stop mechanisms
   - Fail-safe protocols
   - Real-time performance guarantees
   - Hardware-in-the-loop validation

### For Educational Use:
- Use only in simulation environments
- Understand that real-world systems require additional safety measures
- Consult with robotics experts before attempting real-world applications
- Follow all local laws and regulations regarding UAV operations

### Liability:
The authors and contributors of this project assume NO responsibility for any damages, injuries, or legal issues arising from the use of this code on real hardware.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - SIMULATION ONLY**
